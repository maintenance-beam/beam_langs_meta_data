      "body": "# OTP 24 \r\n\r\nErlang/OTP 24 is a new major release with new features, improvements as well as a few incompatibilities.\r\n\r\nBelow are some of the highlights of the release:\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n\r\n### compiler\r\n- The compiler will now inline funs that are used only once immediately after their definition.\r\n- Compiler warnings and errors now include column numbers in addition to line numbers.\r\n- Variables bound between the keywords `'try'` and `'of'` can now be used in the clauses following the `'of'` keyword\r\n  (that is, in the success case when no exception was raised).\r\n- Generators in list and binary comprehensions will now\r\n  raise a `{bad_generator,Generator}` exception if the\r\n  generator has an incorrect type\r\n  Similarly, when a\r\n  filter does not evaluate to a boolean, a\r\n  `{bad_filter,Filter}` exception will be raised.\r\n- Warnings for expressions whose result was ignored that could be suppressed by\r\n  using the anonymous variable `'_'` can now be suppressed with a variable beginning with `'_'`.\r\n- Selective receive optimization will now be applied much\r\n  more often.\r\n  The new `recv_opt_info` compile flag can be used to print\r\n  diagnostics relating to this optimization.\r\n  You can read more about the selective receive\r\n  optimization in the Efficiency Guide.\r\n\r\n\r\n### erts, kernel, stdlib\r\n- hex encoding and decoding functions added in the binary module\r\n- The BeamAsm JIT-compiler has been added to Erlang/OTP and will give a significant performance boost for many applications.\r\n  The JIT-compiler is enabled by default on most x86 64-bit platforms that have a C++ compiler that can compile C++17. \r\n  To verify that a JIT enabled emulator is running you can use `erlang:system_info(emu_flavor)`.\r\n\r\n- A compatibility adaptor for `gen_tcp` to use the new socket API has been implemented (`gen_tcp_socket`).\r\n- Extended error information for failing BIF calls as proposed in EEP 54 has been implemented.\r\n- Process aliases as outlined by EEP 53 has been introduced.\r\n- Implementation of EEP 56 in supervisor. It adds the concept of significant children as well as the `auto_shutdown` supervisor flag. See the supervisor manual page for more information.\r\n\r\n### ftp\r\n- Add support for FTPES (explicit FTP over TLS).\r\n\r\n### ssl\r\n- Make TLS handshakes in Erlang distribution concurrent.\r\n- TLS connections now support EdDSA certificates.\r\n\r\n### wx\r\n- The application has been completely rewritten in order\r\n  to use wxWidgets version 3 as its base.\r\n- Added support for wxWebView.\r\n\r\n### edoc\r\n- EDoc is now capable of emitting EEP-48 doc chunks. This means that, with some\r\n  configuration,  community projects can now provide documentation for shell_docs\r\n  the same way that OTP libraries did since OTP 23.0.\r\n\r\nFor more details about new features and potential incompatibilities see\r\n- https://erlang.org/download/OTP-24.0.README\r\n\r\nPre built versions for Windows can be fetched here:\r\n- [otp_win32_24.0.exe](https://github.com/erlang/otp/releases/download/OTP-24.0/otp_win32_24.0.exe)\r\n- [otp_win64_24.0.exe](https://github.com/erlang/otp/releases/download/OTP-24.0/otp_win64_24.0.exe)\r\n\r\nFor a quicker build a tar file with all the platform independent parts already built (.beam files and doc chunks) can be found here: \r\n- [otp_src_24.0.tar.gz](https://github.com/erlang/otp/releases/download/OTP-24.0/otp_src_24.0.tar.gz)\r\n\r\nOnline documentation can be browsed here:\r\n- http://erlang.org/documentation/doc-12.0/doc\r\n\r\nMany thanks to all the contributors.\r\n\r\n",

        "body": "# OTP 24 \r\n\r\nErlang/OTP 24 is a new major release with new features, improvements as well as a few incompatibilities.\r\n\r\nBelow are some of the highlights of the release:\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n\r\n### compiler\r\n- The compiler will now inline funs that are used only once immediately after their definition.\r\n- Compiler warnings and errors now include column numbers in addition to line numbers.\r\n- Variables bound between the keywords `'try'` and `'of'` can now be used in the clauses following the `'of'` keyword\r\n  (that is, in the success case when no exception was raised).\r\n- Generators in list and binary comprehensions will now\r\n  raise a `{bad_generator,Generator}` exception if the\r\n  generator has an incorrect type\r\n  Similarly, when a\r\n  filter does not evaluate to a boolean, a\r\n  `{bad_filter,Filter}` exception will be raised.\r\n- Warnings for expressions whose result was ignored that could be suppressed by\r\n  using the anonymous variable `'_'` can now be suppressed with a variable beginning with `'_'`.\r\n- Selective receive optimization will now be applied much\r\n  more often.\r\n  The new `recv_opt_info` compile flag can be used to print\r\n  diagnostics relating to this optimization.\r\n  You can read more about the selective receive\r\n  optimization in the Efficiency Guide.\r\n\r\n\r\n### erts, kernel, stdlib\r\n- hex encoding and decoding functions added in the binary module\r\n- The BeamAsm JIT-compiler has been added to Erlang/OTP and will give a significant performance boost for many applications.\r\n  The JIT-compiler is enabled by default on most x86 64-bit platforms that have a C++ compiler that can compile C++17. \r\n  To verify that a JIT enabled emulator is running you can use `erlang:system_info(emu_flavor)`.\r\n\r\n- A compatibility adaptor for `gen_tcp` to use the new socket API has been implemented (`gen_tcp_socket`).\r\n- Extended error information for failing BIF calls as proposed in EEP 54 has been implemented.\r\n- Process aliases as outlined by EEP 53 has been introduced.\r\n- Implementation of EEP 56 in supervisor. It adds the concept of significant children as well as the `auto_shutdown` supervisor flag. See the supervisor manual page for more information.\r\n\r\n### ftp\r\n- Add support for FTPES (explicit FTP over TLS).\r\n\r\n### ssl\r\n- Make TLS handshakes in Erlang distribution concurrent.\r\n- TLS connections now support EdDSA certificates.\r\n\r\n### wx\r\n- The application has been completely rewritten in order\r\n  to use wxWidgets version 3 as its base.\r\n- Added support for wxWebView.\r\n\r\n### edoc\r\n- EDoc is now capable of emitting EEP-48 doc chunks. This means that, with some\r\n  configuration,  community projects can now provide documentation for shell_docs\r\n  the same way that OTP libraries did since OTP 23.0.\r\n\r\nFor more details about new features and potential incompatibilities see\r\n- https://erlang.org/download/OTP-24.0.README\r\n\r\nPre built versions for Windows can be fetched here:\r\n- [otp_win32_24.0.exe](https://github.com/erlang/otp/releases/download/OTP-24.0/otp_win32_24.0.exe)\r\n- [otp_win64_24.0.exe](https://github.com/erlang/otp/releases/download/OTP-24.0/otp_win64_24.0.exe)\r\n\r\nFor a quicker build a tar file with all the platform independent parts already built (.beam files and doc chunks) can be found here: \r\n- [otp_src_24.0.tar.gz](https://github.com/erlang/otp/releases/download/OTP-24.0/otp_src_24.0.tar.gz)\r\n\r\nOnline documentation can be browsed here:\r\n- http://erlang.org/documentation/doc-12.0/doc\r\n\r\nMany thanks to all the contributors.\r\n\r\n",

Some of the new\r\nfeatures are highlighted below.\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n### erts, kernel, stdlib\r\n\r\n- The BeamAsm JIT-compiler has been added to Erlang/OTP and will give a significant performance boost for many applications.\r\n  The JIT-compiler is enabled by default on most x86 64-bit platforms that have a C++ compiler that can compile C++17. \r\n  To verify that a JIT enabled emulator is running you can use `erlang:system_info(emu_flavor)`.\r\n\r\n- A compatibility adaptor for `gen_tcp` to use the new socket API has been implemented (`gen_tcp_socket`).\r\n- Extended error information for failing BIF calls as proposed in EEP 54 has been implemented.\r\n- Process aliases as outlined by EEP 53 has been introduced.\r\n\r\n### compiler\r\n\r\n- Compiler warnings and errors now include column numbers in addition to line numbers.\r\n- Variables bound between the keywords `'try'` and `'of'` can now be used in the clauses following the `'of'` keyword\r\n  (that is, in the success case when no exception was raised).\r\n\r\n### ftp\r\n\r\n- Add support for FTPES (explicit FTP over TLS).\r\n\r\n### ssl\r\n\r\n- Support for the \"early data\" feature for TLS 1.3 servers and clients.\r\n- Make TLS handshakes in Erlang distribution concurrent.\r\n\r\n\r\n### wx\r\n\r\n- The application has been completely rewritten in order\r\n  to use wxWidgets version 3 as its base.\r\n- Added support for wxWebView.\r\n\r\n### edoc\r\n\r\n- EDoc is now capable of emitting EEP-48 doc chunks.

        "body": "# OTP 24 Release Candidate 2\r\n\r\nThis is the second of three planned release candidates before the OTP 24 release.\r\nThe intention with this release is to get feedback from our users. All feedback is welcome, even if it is only to say that it works for you.\r\n\r\nWe encourage users to try it out and give us feedback either by creating an issue here https://github.com/erlang/otp/issues\r\n or by posting to the mailing list erlang-questions@erlang.org.\r\n\r\nErlang/OTP 24 is a new major release with new features, improvements as well as a few incompatibilities. Some of the new\r\nfeatures are highlighted below.\r\n\r\n## Highlights rc2\r\n\r\n### compiler\r\n- The compiler will now inline funs that are used only once immediately after their definition.\r\n\r\n### erts, kernel, stdlib\r\n- hex encoding and decoding functions added in the binary module\r\n\r\n#### There is as usual a number of bug fixes and improvements detailed in the readme.\r\n\r\n## Highlights rc1\r\n### erts, kernel, stdlib\r\n\r\n- The BeamAsm JIT-compiler has been added to Erlang/OTP and will give a significant performance boost for many applications.\r\n  The JIT-compiler is enabled by default on most x86 64-bit platforms that have a C++ compiler that can compile C++17. \r\n  To verify that a JIT enabled emulator is running you can use `erlang:system_info(emu_flavor)`.\r\n\r\n- A compatibility adaptor for `gen_tcp` to use the new socket API has been implemented (`gen_tcp_socket`).\r\n- Extended error information for failing BIF calls as proposed in EEP 54 has been implemented.\r\n- Process aliases as outlined by EEP 53 has been introduced.\r\n\r\n### compiler\r\n\r\n- Compiler warnings and errors now include column numbers in addition to line numbers.\r\n- Variables bound between the keywords `'try'` and `'of'` can now be used in the clauses following the `'of'` keyword\r\n  (that is, in the success case when no exception was raised).\r\n\r\n### ftp\r\n\r\n- Add support for FTPES (explicit FTP over TLS).\r\n\r\n### ssl\r\n\r\n- Support for the \"early data\" feature for TLS 1.3 servers and clients.\r\n- Make TLS handshakes in Erlang distribution concurrent.\r\n\r\n\r\n### wx\r\n\r\n- The application has been completely rewritten in order\r\n  to use wxWidgets version 3 as its base.\r\n- Added support for wxWebView.\r\n\r\n### edoc\r\n\r\n- EDoc is now capable of emitting EEP-48 doc chunks. This means that, with some configuration, community projects\r\n  can now provide documentation for shell_docs the same way that OTP libraries did since OTP 23.0.\r\n\r\nFor more details about new features and potential incompatibilities see\r\nhttps://erlang.org/download/OTP-24.0-rc2.README\r\n\r\nPre built versions for Windows can be fetched here:\r\nhttp://erlang.org/download/otp_win32_24.0-rc2.exe\r\nhttp://erlang.org/download/otp_win64_24.0-rc2.exe\r\n\r\nOnline documentation can be browsed here:\r\nhttp://erlang.org/documentation/doc-12.0-rc2/doc/\r\n\r\nThe Erlang/OTP source can also be found at GitHub on the official Erlang repository,\r\nhttps://github.com/erlang/otp\r\n\r\n",

        "body": "# OTP 24 Release Candidate 3\r\n\r\nThis is the last of three planned release candidates before the OTP 24 release.\r\nThe intention with this release is to get feedback from our users. All feedback is welcome, even if it is only to say that it works for you.\r\n\r\nWe encourage users to try it out and give us feedback either by creating an issue here https://github.com/erlang/otp/issues\r\n or by posting to the mailing list erlang-questions@erlang.org.\r\n\r\nErlang/OTP 24 is a new major release with new features, improvements as well as a few incompatibilities. Some of the new\r\nfeatures are highlighted below.\r\n\r\n## Highlights rc3\r\n### stdlib\r\n- Implementation of EEP 56 in supervisor. It adds the concept of significant children as well as the auto_shutdown supervisor flag. See the supervisor manual page for more information.\r\n\r\n## Highlights rc2\r\n\r\n### compiler\r\n- The compiler will now inline funs that are used only once immediately after their definition.\r\n\r\n### erts, kernel, stdlib\r\n- hex encoding and decoding functions added in the binary module\r\n\r\n#### There is as usual a number of bug fixes and improvements detailed in the readme.\r\n\r\n## Highlights rc1\r\n### erts, kernel, stdlib\r\n\r\n- The BeamAsm JIT-compiler has been added to Erlang/OTP and will give a significant performance boost for many applications.\r\n  The JIT-compiler is enabled by default on most x86 64-bit platforms that have a C++ compiler that can compile C++17. \r\n  To verify that a JIT enabled emulator is running you can use `erlang:system_info(emu_flavor)`.\r\n\r\n- A compatibility adaptor for `gen_tcp` to use the new socket API has been implemented (`gen_tcp_socket`).\r\n- Extended error information for failing BIF calls as proposed in EEP 54 has been implemented.\r\n- Process aliases as outlined by EEP 53 has been introduced.\r\n\r\n### compiler\r\n\r\n- Compiler warnings and errors now include column numbers in addition to line numbers.\r\n- Variables bound between the keywords `'try'` and `'of'` can now be used in the clauses following the `'of'` keyword\r\n  (that is, in the success case when no exception was raised).\r\n\r\n### ftp\r\n\r\n- Add support for FTPES (explicit FTP over TLS).\r\n\r\n### ssl\r\n\r\n- Support for the \"early data\" feature for TLS 1.3 servers and clients.\r\n- Make TLS handshakes in Erlang distribution concurrent.\r\n\r\n\r\n### wx\r\n\r\n- The application has been completely rewritten in order\r\n  to use wxWidgets version 3 as its base.\r\n- Added support for wxWebView.\r\n\r\n### edoc\r\n\r\n- EDoc is now capable of emitting EEP-48 doc chunks. This means that, with some configuration, community projects\r\n  can now provide documentation for shell_docs the same way that OTP libraries did since OTP 23.0.\r\n\r\nFor more details about new features and potential incompatibilities see\r\nhttps://erlang.org/download/OTP-24.0-rc3.README\r\n\r\nPre built versions for Windows can be fetched here:\r\nhttps://erlang.org/download/otp_win32_24.0-rc3.exe\r\nhttps://erlang.org/download/otp_win64_24.0-rc3.exe\r\n\r\nOnline documentation can be browsed here:\r\nhttp://erlang.org/documentation/doc-12.0-rc3/doc/\r\n\r\nThe Erlang/OTP source can also be found at GitHub on the official Erlang repository,\r\nhttps://github.com/erlang/otp\r\n\r\n",

        "body": "Erlang/OTP 24.2 is the second maintenance patch release for OTP 24, with mostly\r\nbug fixes as well as a few improvements.\r\n\r\nBelow are some highlights of the release:\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n\r\n- **crypto**: The `crypto` app in OTP can now be compiled, linked and\r\n               used with the new `OpenSSL 3.0` cryptolib. It has not yet been extensively tested, \r\n               so only recommended for experiments and alpha testing in this release. \r\n               There are not yet any guaranties that it works, not even together with other\r\n               OTP applications like for example SSL and SSH, although\r\n               there are no known errors.\r\n- **erts**: An option for enabling dirty scheduler specific\r\n               allocator instances has been introduced. By default\r\n               such allocator instances are disabled. For more\r\n               information see the documentation of the `+Mdai` argument\r\n               to the `erl`command\r\n\r\n- **erl_docgen, erts**: All predefined types have been added to the `erlang`\r\n              module together with documentation.\r\n              Any reference to a predefined type now links to that\r\n              documentation so that the user can view it.\r\n\r\n- **erts**: Responsiveness of processes executing on normal or low\r\n               priority could suffer due to code purging or literal\r\n               area removal on systems with a huge amount of\r\n               processes. This since during these operations all\r\n               processes on the system were scheduled for execution at\r\n               once. The new solution is to limit the number of outstanding \r\n               purge and copy requests to 2 times the number of schedulers as default\r\n\r\nFor more details about the new features and potential incompatibilities see\r\nhttps://erlang.org/download/OTP-24.2.README\r\n\r\n\r\nOnline documentation can be browsed here:\r\nhttps://www.erlang.org/docs/24/\r\n\r\nThe Erlang/OTP source can also be found at GitHub on the official Erlang repository,\r\nhttps://github.com/erlang/otp\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "## OTP 23\r\n\r\nErlang/OTP 23 is a new major release with new features, improvements as well as a few incompatibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Potential Incompatibilities\r\n- **SSL**:\r\n    - Support for SSL 3.0 is completely removed.\r\n    - TLS 1.3 is added to the list of default supported versions.   \r\n- `erl_interface`: Removed the deprecated parts of `erl_interface` (`erl_interface.h` and essentially all C functions with prefix `erl_`).\r\n- The deprecated `erlang:get_stacktrace/0` BIF now returns an empty list instead of a stacktrace. `erlang:get_stacktrace/0` is scheduled for removal in OTP 24.\r\n\r\n### Improvements and new features\r\n- **ssh**: \r\n    - OpenSSH 6.5 introduced a new file representation of keys called `openssh-key-v1`. This is now supported with the exception of handling encrypted keys.\r\n    - Algorithm configuration could now be done in a .config file. This is useful for example to enable an algorithm that is disabled by default without need to change the code.  \r\n- **SSL**:\r\n    - Support for the middlebox compatibility mode makes the TLS 1.3 handshake look more like a TLS 1.2 handshake and increases the chance of successfully establishing TLS 1.3 connections through legacy middleboxes.\r\n    - Add support for key exchange with Edward curves and PSS-RSA padding in signature verification\r\n\r\n- The possibility to run Erlang distribution without relying on EPMD has been extended. To achieve this a couple of new options to the inet distribution has been added.\r\n    - `-dist_listen false` Setup the distribution channel, but do not listen for incoming connection.\r\n    - `-erl_epmd_port Port`  Configure a default port that the built-in EPMD client should return.\r\n- A first EXPERIMENTAL `socket` backend to\r\n `gen_tcp` and `inet` has been implemented. `gen_udp` and `gen_sctp` will follow. \r\n  Putting `{inet_backend, socket}` as first option to `listen()` or `connect()` makes it easy to try this for  existing code\r\n\r\n- A new module `erpc` in kernel which implements an enhanced subset of the operations provided by the `rpc` module. Enhanced in the sense that it makes it possible to distinguish between returned value, raised exceptions and other errors. `erpc` also has better performance and scalability than the original `rpc` implementation. This by utilizing the newly introduced `spawn_request()` BIF. Also the `rpc` module benefits from these improvements by utilizing `erpc` when possible.\r\n- Scalability and performance Improvements plus new functionality regarding distributed spawn operations. \r\n- In binary matching, the size of the segment to be matched is now allowed to be a guard expression (EEP-52)\r\n- When matching with maps the keys can now be guard expressions (EEP-52).\r\n- ssh: support for TCP/IP port forwarding, a.k.a tunnelling a.k.a as tcp-forward/direct-tcp is implemented. In the OpenSSH client, this corresponds to the options -L and -R.\r\n- Allow underscores in numeric literals to improve readability. Examples: `123_456_789`, `16#1234_ABCD`.\r\n- New functions in the shell for displaying documentation for Erlang modules, functions and types. The\r\n  functions are:\r\n    - `h/1,2,3` -- Print the documentation for a `Module:Function/Arity`.\r\n    - `ht/1,2,3` -- Print the type documentation for a `Module:Type/Arity`.\r\n  The embedded documentation is created as docchunks (EEP 48) when building the Erlang/OTP documentation.\r\n- **kernel**: The module `pg` with a new implementation of distributed named process groups is introduced. The old module `pg2` is deprecated and scheduled for removal in OTP 24.\r\n- Our tool chain for building the Windows packages is upgraded with new C++ compiler, Java compiler, OpenSSL libraries and wxWidgets versions. We are now using WSL (the Linux Subsystem for Windows when building) which makes it easier to handle the build environment.\r\n\r\nFor more details see\r\nhttp://erlang.org/download/otp_src_23.0.readme\r\n\r\nPre built versions for Windows can be fetched here:\r\nhttp://erlang.org/download/otp_win32_23.0.exe\r\nhttp://erlang.org/download/otp_win64_23.0.exe\r\n\r\nOnline documentation can be browsed here:\r\nhttp://erlang.org/documentation/doc-11.0/doc\r\nThe Erlang/OTP source can also be found at GitHub on the official Erlang repository,\r\nhttps://github.com/erlang/otp\r\n\r\n",

Enhanced in the sense that it makes it possible to distinguish between returned value, raised exceptions and other errors. `erpc` also has better performance and scalability than the original `rpc` implementation. This by utilizing the newly introduced `spawn_request()` BIF. Also the `rpc` module benefits from these improvements by utilizing `erpc` when possible.\r\n- Scalability and performance Improvements plus new functionality regarding distributed spawn operations. \r\n- In binary matching, the size of the segment to be matched is now allowed to be a guard expression (EEP-52)\r\n- When matching with maps the keys can now be guard expressions (EEP-52).\r\n- ssh: support for TCP/IP port forwarding, a.k.a tunneling a.k.a as tcp-forward/direct-tcp is implemented. In the OpenSSH client, this corresponds to the options -L and -R.\r\n- Allow underscores in numeric literals to improve readability. Examples: `123_456_789`, `16#1234_ABCD`.\r\n- New functions in the shell for displaying documentation for Erlang modules, functions and types. The\r\n  functions are:\r\n    - `h/1,2,3` -- Print the documentation for a `Module:Function/Arity`.\r\n    - `ht/1,2,3` -- Print the type documentation for a `Module:Type/Arity`.\r\n  The embedded documentation is created as docchunks (EEP 48) when building the Erlang/OTP documentation.\r\n- kernel: The module `pg` with a new implementation of distributed named process groups is introduced. The old module `pg2` is deprecated and scheduled for removal in OTP 24.\r\n- Our tool chain for building the Windows packages is upgraded with new C++ compiler, Java compiler, OpenSSL libraries and wxWidgets versions. We are now using WSL (the Linux Subsystem for Windows when building) which makes it easier to handle the build environment.\r\n- ...\r\n\r\nFor more details see\r\nhttp://erlang.org/download/otp_src_23.0-rc1.readme\r\n\r\nPre built versions for Windows can be fetched here:\r\nhttp://erlang.org/download/otp_win32_23.0-rc1.exe\r\nhttp://erlang.org/download/otp_win64_23.0-rc1.exe\r\n\r\nOnline documentation can be browsed here:\r\nhttp://erlang.org/documentation/doc-11.0-rc1/doc\r\nThe Erlang/OTP source can also be found at GitHub on the official Erlang repository,\r\nhttps://github.com/erlang/otp\r\n\r\n",

This is now supported with the exception of\r\n      handling encrypted keys.\r\n    - Algorithm configuration could now be done in a .config file.\r\n      This is useful for example to enable an algorithm that\r\n      is disabled by default without need to change the code.\r\n- **ssl**: \r\n    - Support for the middlebox compatibility mode makes the TLS 1.3 handshake \r\n      look more like a TLS 1.2 handshake and increases the chance of successfully\r\n      establishing TLS 1.3 connections through legacy middleboxes.\r\n    - Add support for key exchange with Edward curves and PSS-RSA padding in \r\n    signature verification\r\n- The possibility to run Erlang distribution without\r\nrelying on EPMD has been extended. To achieve this a\r\ncouple of new options to the inet distribution has been\r\nadded.\r\n    - `-dist_listen false` Setup the distribution\r\n       channel, but do not listen for incoming connection.\r\n    - `-erl_epmd_port Port`  Configure a default port that\r\n               the built-in EPMD client should return.\r\n    - ...\r\n- A first EXPERIMENTAL `socket` backend to\r\n `gen_tcp` and `inet` has been implemented. `gen_udp` and `gen_sctp` will follow. \r\n  Putting `{inet_backend, socket}` as first option to `listen()` or `connect()` makes it easy to try this for \r\n  existing code\r\n### Highlights (rc1)\r\n- A new module `erpc` in kernel which implements an enhanced subset of the operations provided by the `rpc` module. Enhanced in the sense that it makes it possible to distinguish between returned value, raised exceptions and other errors. `erpc` also has better performance and scalability than the original `rpc` implementation.

        "body": "## OTP 23 Release Candidate 3\r\nThis is the third and last of three planned release candidates before the OTP 23 release.\r\nThe intention with this release is to get feedback from our users. **All feedback is welcome**, even if it is only to say that it works for you.\r\n\r\nErlang/OTP 23 is a new major release with new features, improvements as well as a few incompatibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Highlights (rc3)\r\nApart from the changes below, this third pre-release contains only minor fixes.\r\n\r\n### Potential Incompatibilities\r\n- SSL:\r\n    - Support for SSL 3.0 is completely removed.\r\n    - TLS 1.3 is added to the list of default supported versions.\r\n- `erl_interface`: Removed the deprecated parts of `erl_interface`\r\n               (`erl_interface.h` and essentially all C functions with prefix `erl_`).\r\n- The deprecated `erlang:get_stacktrace/0` BIF now returns an empty list instead of a stacktrace. \r\n  `erlang:get_stacktrace/0` is scheduled for removal in OTP 24.\r\n- ...\r\n### Highlights (rc2)\r\n-  **ssh**: \r\n    - OpenSSH 6.5 introduced a new file representation of\r\n      keys called `openssh-key-v1`. This is now supported with the exception of\r\n      handling encrypted keys.\r\n    - Algorithm configuration could now be done in a .config file.\r\n      This is useful for example to enable an algorithm that\r\n      is disabled by default without need to change the code.\r\n- **ssl**: \r\n    - Support for the middlebox compatibility mode makes the TLS 1.3 handshake \r\n      look more like a TLS 1.2 handshake and increases the chance of successfully\r\n      establishing TLS 1.3 connections through legacy middleboxes.\r\n    - Add support for key exchange with Edward curves and PSS-RSA padding in \r\n    signature verification\r\n- The possibility to run Erlang distribution without\r\nrelying on EPMD has been extended. To achieve this a\r\ncouple of new options to the inet distribution has been\r\nadded.\r\n    - `-dist_listen false` Setup the distribution\r\n       channel, but do not listen for incoming connection.\r\n    - `-erl_epmd_port Port`  Configure a default port that\r\n               the built-in EPMD client should return.\r\n    - ...\r\n- A first EXPERIMENTAL `socket` backend to\r\n `gen_tcp` and `inet` has been implemented. `gen_udp` and `gen_sctp` will follow. \r\n  Putting `{inet_backend, socket}` as first option to `listen()` or `connect()` makes it easy to try this for \r\n  existing code\r\n### Highlights (rc1)\r\n- A new module `erpc` in kernel which implements an enhanced subset of the operations provided by the `rpc` module. Enhanced in the sense that it makes it possible to distinguish between returned value, raised exceptions and other errors. `erpc` also has better performance and scalability than the original `rpc` implementation. This by utilizing the newly introduced `spawn_request()` BIF. Also the `rpc` module benefits from these improvements by utilizing `erpc` when possible.\r\n- Scalability and performance Improvements plus new functionality regarding distributed spawn operations. \r\n- In binary matching, the size of the segment to be matched is now allowed to be a guard expression (EEP-52)\r\n- When matching with maps the keys can now be guard expressions (EEP-52).\r\n- ssh: support for TCP/IP port forwarding, a.k.a tunneling a.k.a as tcp-forward/direct-tcp is implemented. In the OpenSSH client, this corresponds to the options -L and -R.\r\n- Allow underscores in numeric literals to improve readability. Examples: `123_456_789`, `16#1234_ABCD`.\r\n- New functions in the shell for displaying documentation for Erlang modules, functions and types. The\r\n  functions are:\r\n    - `h/1,2,3` -- Print the documentation for a `Module:Function/Arity`.\r\n    - `ht/1,2,3` -- Print the type documentation for a `Module:Type/Arity`.\r\n  The embedded documentation is created as docchunks (EEP 48) when building the Erlang/OTP documentation.\r\n- kernel: The module `pg` with a new implementation of distributed named process groups is introduced. The old module `pg2` is deprecated and scheduled for removal in OTP 24.\r\n- Our tool chain for building the Windows packages is upgraded with new C++ compiler, Java compiler, OpenSSL libraries and wxWidgets versions. We are now using WSL (the Linux Subsystem for Windows when building) which makes it easier to handle the build environment.\r\n- ...\r\n\r\nFor more details see\r\nhttp://erlang.org/download/otp_src_23.0-rc3.readme\r\n\r\nPre built versions for Windows can be fetched here:\r\nhttp://erlang.org/download/otp_win32_23.0-rc3.exe\r\nhttp://erlang.org/download/otp_win64_23.0-rc3.exe\r\n\r\nOnline documentation can be browsed here:\r\nhttp://erlang.org/documentation/doc-11.0-rc3/doc\r\nThe Erlang/OTP source can also be found at GitHub on the official Erlang repository,\r\nhttps://github.com/erlang/otp\r\n\r\n",

The cert and certfile options will now accept a list of certificates so that the user may specify the chain explicitly.\r\n\r\n### Potential incompatibility \r\n#### stdlib\r\n\r\nImproved the API and documentation of the uri_string module. Added a new chapter to the Users Guide about Uniform Resource Identifiers and their handling with the new API. Added two new API functions: uri_string:allowed_characters/0 and uri_string:percent_decode/1.\r\n\r\nThis change has been marked as potentially incompatible as uri_string:normalize/2 used to decode percent-encoded character triplets that corresponded to characters not in the reserved set. After this change, uri_string:normalize/2 will only decode those percent-encoded triplets that correspond to characters in the unreserved set (ALPHA / DIGIT / \"-\" / \".\" / \"_\" / \"~\").\r\n\r\n\r\nA full list of bug fixes and improvements in the [readme](https://erlang.org/download/OTP-23.2.README).\r\n\r\n#### Download and documentation\r\nOnline documentation can be browsed here:  \r\nhttps://erlang.org/documentation/doc-11.1.4/doc  \r\n\r\nPre-built versions for Windows can be fetched here:  \r\nhttps://erlang.org/download/otp_win32_23.2.exe  \r\nhttps://erlang.org/download/otp_win64_23.2.exe  \r\n\r\nThe Erlang/OTP source can also be found at GitHub on the official Erlang repository:  \r\nhttps://github.com/erlang/otp",

This does not apply to the ei library.\r\n- VxWorks is deprecated as of OTP 22 and will be removed in OTP 23.\r\n\r\n### New Features\r\n\r\n#### Erts:\r\n\r\n- Support for Erlang Distribution protocol to split the payload of large signals into several fragments.\r\n- ETS option write_concurrency now also effects and improves scalability of ordered_set tables.\r\n- The length/1 BIF used to calculate the length of the list in one go without yielding, even if the list was very long. Now it yields when called with long lists.\r\n- A new (still experimental) module socket is introduced. It is implemented as a NIF and the idea is that it shall be as \"close as possible\" to the OS level socket interface.\r\n- Added the NIF function enif_term_type, which helps avoid long sequences of enif_is_xyz by returning the type of the given term. This is especially helpful for NIFs that serialize terms, such as JSON encoders, where it can improve both performance and readability.\r\n\r\n#### Compiler:\r\n\r\n- The compiler has been rewritten to internally use an intermediate representation based on Static Single Assignment (SSA). The new intermediate representation makes more optimizations possible.\r\n- The binary matching optimizations are now applicable in many more circumstances than before.\r\n- Type optimizations are now applied across local function calls, and will remove a lot more redundant type tests than before.\r\n- All compiler options that can be given in the source file can now be given in the option list on the command line for erlc.\r\n- In OTP 22, HiPE (the native code compiler) is not fully functional. The reasons for this are new BEAM instructions for binary matching that the HiPE native code compiler does not support. If erlc is invoked with the +native option, and if any of the new binary matching instructions are used, the compiler will issue a warning and produce a BEAM file without native code.\r\n\r\n#### Standard libraries:\r\n\r\n- Cover now uses the counters module instead of ets for updating counters. The new function cover:local_only/0 allows running Cover in a restricted but faster local-only mode. The increase in speed will vary depending on the type of code being cover-compiled, as an example the compiler test suite runs more than twice as fast with the new Cover.\r\n- A simple socket API is provided through the socket module. This is a low level API that does *not* replace gen_[tcp|udp|sctp]. It is intended to *eventually* replace the inet driver. It also provides a basic API that facilitates the implementation of other protocols than TCP, UDP and SCTP. Known issues are; No support for the Windows OS (currently), a small term leakage. This feature will be classed as experimental in OTP 22.\r\n- SSL: now uses the new logger API, including log levels and verbose debug logging.\r\n- SSL: Basic support for TLS 1.3 Server for experimental use.\r\n- Crypto: The new hash_info/1 and cipher_info/1 functions returns maps with information about the hash or cipher in the argument.\r\n\r\nFor more details see\r\nhttp://erlang.org/download/otp_src_22.0.readme\r\n\r\nPre built versions for Windows can be fetched here:\r\nhttp://erlang.org/download/otp_win32_22.0.exe\r\nhttp://erlang.org/download/otp_win64_22.0.exe\r\n\r\nOnline documentation can be browsed here:\r\nhttp://erlang.org/doc/search/\r\n\r\nThe Erlang/OTP source can also be found at GitHub on the official Erlang repository:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/erlang/otp/releases/tag/OTP-22.0\r\n\r\nMake sure to report any and all bugs here:\r\n\r\nhttps://bugs.erlang.org/\r\n\r\nThank you for all your contributions!",

This does not apply to the ei library.\r\n- VxWorks is deprecated as of OTP 22 and will be removed in OTP 23.\r\n\r\n### New Features\r\n\r\n#### Erts:\r\n\r\n- Support for Erlang Distribution protocol to split the payload of large signals into several fragments.\r\n- ETS option write_concurrency now also effects and improves scalability of ordered_set tables.\r\n- The length/1 BIF used to calculate the length of the list in one go without yielding, even if the list was very long.

        "body": "## OTP 22.1 \r\n\r\nErlang/OTP 22.1 is the first service release for the 22 major release with new features, improvements as well as bugfixes\r\n\r\n### Potential Incompatibilities\r\n- Mnesia: Transactions with sticky locks could with async_asym transactions be committed in the wrong order, since asym transactions are spawned on the remote nodes. To fix this bug the communication protocol between mnesia nodes had to be updated, thus mnesia will no longer be able to connect to nodes earlier than mnesia-4.14 , OTP-19.0.\r\n- Stdlib: Debugging of time-outs in gen_statem has been improved. Starting a time-out is now logged in sys:log and sys:trace. Running time-outs are visible in server crash logs, and with sys:get_status. Due to this system events {start_timer, Action, State} and {insert_timout, Event, State} have been added, which may surprise tools that rely on the format of these events. New features: The EventContent of a running time-out can be updated with {TimeoutType, update, NewEventContent}. Running time-outs can be cancelled with {TimeoutType, cancel} which is more readable than using Time = infinity.{rel, Name, Vsn, RelApps, Opts}.\r\n\r\n### Highlights\r\n\r\n#### Compiler:\r\n- erlc can now automatically use a compile server to avoid starting an Erlang system for each file to be compiled in a multi-file project. See the documentation for how to enable it.\r\n\r\n#### Standard libraries:\r\n- SSL: Basic support for TLS 1.3 Client for experimental use. For more information see the Standards Compliance chapter of the User's Guide.\r\n- crypto: The Message Authentication Codes (MAC) CMAC, HMAC and Poly1305 are unified into common functions in the New Crypto API. See the manual for CRYPTO. cipher_info/1 functions returns maps with information about the hash or cipher in the argument.\r\n\r\nFor more details see\r\nhttp://erlang.org/download/otp_src_22.1.readme\r\nPre built versions for Windows can be fetched here:\r\nhttp://erlang.org/download/otp_win32_22.1.exe\r\nhttp://erlang.org/download/otp_win64_22.1.exe\r\nOnline documentation can be browsed here:\r\nhttp://erlang.org/doc/search/\r\nThe source tarball can be fetched here:\r\nhttp://erlang.org/download/otp_src_22.1.tar.gz\r\nThe documentation can be fetched here:\r\nhttp://erlang.org/download/otp_doc_html_22.1.tar.gz\r\nThe man pages can be fetched here:\r\nhttp://erlang.org/download/otp_doc_man_22.1.tar.gz\r\nThe Erlang/OTP source can also be found at GitHub on the official Erlang repository:\r\nhttps://github.com/erlang/otp\r\nOTP-22.1\r\n\r\nThank you for all your contributions!",

        "body": "## OTP 22.3 \r\n\r\nErlang/OTP 22.3 is the last planned patch package for the 22 major release with new features, improvements and bugfixes. Below follows some highlights.\r\n\r\n### Highlights\r\n- **ssl/public_key**: \r\n    - Implementation of the key and initialization vector\r\nupdate feature, and general hardening of TLS 1.3.\r\nThere are cryptographic limits on the amount of\r\nplaintext which can be safely encrypted under a given set of keys.\r\nThis change enforces those limits by triggering\r\nautomatic key updates on TLS 1.3 connections.\r\n    - Add support for TLS 1.3 Session Tickets (stateful and\r\nstateless). This allows session resumption using keying\r\nmaterial from a previous successful handshake.\r\n    - Add support for key exchange with Edward curves and\r\nPSS-RSA padding in signature verification.\r\n- **erts**: \r\n    - A socket \"registry\" has been added making it possible to list current open sockets.\r\n    - Add a \"full featured\" version of getifaddrs in the net module.\r\n- **ssh**: \r\n    - The new functions ssh:set_sock_opts/2 and ssh:get_sock_opts/2 sets and reads option values for\r\nthe underlying TCP stream.\r\n    - Changes to the internal api of the experimental `ssh_dbg` tool.\r\n- **common_test**: The ct_property_test has now a report function for\r\nresults of stateful testing.\r\n- **stdlib**:\r\n    - Implement uri_string:resolve/{2,3} that can be used to\r\nresolve a URI reference against a base URI.\r\n    - In gen_statem it is now possible to change the callback\r\nmodule for a running server. See gen_statem's\r\ndocumentation for `change_callback_module`,\r\n`push_callback_module`, and `pop_callback_module`.\r\n\r\nFor more details see\r\nhttp://erlang.org/download/otp_src_22.3.readme\r\nPre built versions for Windows can be fetched here:\r\nhttp://erlang.org/download/otp_win32_22.3.exe\r\nhttp://erlang.org/download/otp_win64_22.3.exe\r\nOnline documentation can be browsed here:\r\nhttp://erlang.org/doc/search/\r\nThe source tarball can be fetched here:\r\nhttp://erlang.org/download/otp_src_22.3.tar.gz\r\nThe documentation can be fetched here:\r\nhttp://erlang.org/download/otp_doc_html_22.3.tar.gz\r\nThe man pages can be fetched here:\r\nhttp://erlang.org/download/otp_doc_man_22.3.tar.gz\r\nThe Erlang/OTP source can also be found at GitHub on the official Erlang repository:\r\nhttps://github.com/erlang/otp\r\nOTP-22.3\r\n\r\nThank you for all your contributions!",

      "body": "Erlang/OTP 21 is a new major release with new features, improvements as well as incompatibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\nPotential Incompatibilities\r\n\r\n* All Corba applications are now moved from the OTP repository\r\n* A new Corba repository will be created https://github.com/erlang\r\n* New applications ftp and tftp, moved from inets\r\n* ssl no longer supports 3_DES cipher suites or RSA-key exchange cipher suites by default\r\n* Erlang:monitor on a primitive node (erl_interface, jinterface, etc) will no longer fail with badarg exception. Instead a monitor will be created, but it will only supervise the connection to the node.\r\n\r\n Highlights\r\n Erts:\r\n\r\n* Enhanced IO scalability\r\n* Support for usage of distribution controller processes for alternative transports, routing etc\r\n* compact instructions on 64bit systems for code below 4GB 20% less memory for loaded code\r\n* Rewrite of the efile-driver with NIFs and \"Dirty schedulers\" resulting in faster file operations\r\n    non-smp VM removed\r\n* link and monitor optimized for scalability\r\n* `os:getenv/putenv` now work on thread-safe emulation. No longer in sync with `libc getenv(3)`. Manual synchronization will be needed.\r\n\r\nCompiler:\r\n\r\n* Misc compiler optimizations including contributions from the Elixir team resulting in 10% improvements in benchmarks\r\n* \"Tuple calls\" have been removed from the run-time system.\r\n* Code such as `f({ok, Val}) -> {ok, Val}` is now automatically rewritten to `f({ok, Val} = Tuple) -> Tuple`. this reduces code size, execution time, and removed GC pressure.\r\n* More information in stacktrace from a number of operators\r\n* erlang:get_stacktrace/0 deprecated to be replaced with try ... catch C:R:Stacktrace -> ...\r\n* Creation of small maps with literal keys optimized.\r\n* A new predefined macro `OTP_RELEASE` and preprocessor directives `-if` and  `-elif`\r\n\r\nSecurity:\r\n\r\n* DTLS is now supported in the SSL application\r\n* Enhanced support for distribution over TLS\r\n* \"unsecure\" ciphers removed from defaults in SSL and SSH.\r\n* A new option value defined to facilitate implementing exec servers. Old option kept for compatibility, but now gives errors on stderror.\r\n\r\nStandard libraries:\r\n\r\n* New API for logging, logger\r\n* New uri_string module for parsing URIs according to \"The standard\"\r\n* New function `lists:search(list,fun/1) -> {ok, Value} | false`\r\n* Changed default behaviour of .erlang loading. escript, erlc, dialyzer and typer no longer load an .erlang at all.\r\n\r\nFor more details see\r\nhttp://erlang.org/download/otp_src_21.0.readme\r\n\r\nPre built versions for Windows can be fetched here:\r\nhttp://erlang.org/download/otp_win32_21.0.exe\r\nhttp://erlang.org/download/otp_win64_21.0.exe\r\n\r\nOnline documentation can be browsed here:\r\nhttp://erlang.org/documentation/doc-10.0/doc",

Instead a monitor will be created, but it will only supervise the connection to the node.\r\n\r\n Highlights\r\n Erts:\r\n\r\n* Enhanced IO scalability\r\n* Support for usage of distribution controller processes for alternative transports, routing etc\r\n* compact instructions on 64bit systems for code below 4GB 20% less memory for loaded code\r\n* Rewrite of the efile-driver with NIFs and \"Dirty schedulers\" resulting in faster file operations\r\n    non-smp VM removed\r\n* link and monitor optimized for scalability\r\n* `os:getenv/putenv` now work on thread-safe emulation. No longer in sync with `libc getenv(3)`. Manual synchronization will be needed.\r\n\r\nCompiler:\r\n\r\n* Misc compiler optimizations including contributions from the Elixir team resulting in 10% improvements in benchmarks\r\n* \"Tuple calls\" have been removed from the run-time system.\r\n* Code such as `f({ok, Val}) -> {ok, Val}` is now automatically rewritten to `f({ok, Val} = Tuple) -> Tuple`. this reduces code size, execution time, and removed GC pressure.\r\n* More information in stacktrace from a number of operators\r\n* erlang:get_stacktrace/0 deprecated to be replaced with try ... catch C:R:Stacktrace -> ...\r\n* Creation of small maps with literal keys optimized.\r\n* A new predefined macro `OTP_RELEASE` and preprocessor directives `-if` and  `-elif`\r\n\r\nSecurity:\r\n\r\n* DTLS is now supported in the SSL application\r\n* Enhanced support for distribution over TLS\r\n* \"unsecure\" ciphers removed from defaults in SSL and SSH.\r\n* A new option value defined to facilitate implementing exec servers. Old option kept for compatibility, but now gives errors on stderror.\r\n\r\nStandard libraries:\r\n\r\n* New API for logging, logger\r\n* New uri_string module for parsing URIs according to \"The standard\"\r\n* New function `lists:search(list,fun/1) -> {ok, Value} | false`\r\n* Changed default behaviour of .erlang loading. escript, erlc, dialyzer and typer no longer load an .erlang at all.\r\n\r\nFor more details see\r\nhttp://erlang.org/download/otp_src_21.0.readme\r\n\r\nPre built versions for Windows can be fetched here:\r\nhttp://erlang.org/download/otp_win32_21.0.exe\r\nhttp://erlang.org/download/otp_win64_21.0.exe\r\n\r\nOnline documentation can be browsed here:\r\nhttp://erlang.org/documentation/doc-10.0/doc",

        "body": "Erlang/OTP 20.1 is the first service release for the 20 major release.\r\nThe service release contains mostly bug fixes and characteristics improvements but also some new features.\r\n\r\nSome highlights for 20.1\r\n\r\n- **crypto, public_key**: Extend crypto and public_key functions sign and verify with:\r\n    - support for RSASSA-PS padding for signatures and for\r\n       saltlength setting\r\n    - X9.31 RSA padding.\r\n    - sha, sha224, sha256, sha384, and sha512 for dss\r\n       signatures as mentioned in NIST SP 800-57 Part 1.\r\n    - ripemd160 to be used for rsa signatures.\r\n- A new tuple in `crypto:supports/0` reports supported MAC\r\n    algorithms.\r\n\r\n- **diameter**: \r\n    - Add service option `decode_format` to allow incoming messages to be decoded into maps\r\n      instead of records. \r\n    - Decode performance has been improved.\r\n    - Add service/transport option avp_dictionaries to give better support for dictionaries only defining AVPs.\r\n\r\n- **erts**: Upgraded the ERTS internal PCRE library from version 8.40 to version 8.41.\r\n- **erts, kernel, tools**: Profiling with lock counting can now be fully toggled at runtime in\r\n    the lock counting emulator (-emu_type lcnt). Everything\r\n    is enabled by default to match the old behavior, but\r\n    specific categories can be toggled at will with minimal\r\n    runtime overhead when disabled. Refer to the\r\n    documentation on `lcnt:rt_mask/1` for details.\r\n\r\n    `lcnt:collect` and `lcnt:clear` will no longer block all\r\n     other threads in the runtime system. This makes it possible to run the lock counting\r\n     under heavier load.\r\n\r\n- **erts**: The `zlib` module has been refactored and all its operations will now yield appropriately, \r\n    allowing them to be used freely in concurrent applications.\r\n\r\n- **erts, tools**: Add `erlang:iolist_to_iovec/1`, which converts an\r\n    `iolist()` to an `erlang:iovec()`, which is suitable for use\r\n    with `enif_inspect_iovec()`.\r\n\r\n- **erts**: Add new nif API functions for managing an I/O Queue.\r\n    The added functions are: `enif_ioq_create()`, `enif_ioq_destroy()`, `enif_ioq_enq_binary()`,\r\n    `enif_ioq_enqv()`, `enif_ioq_deq()`, `enif_ioq_peek()`,  `enif_inspect_iovec()`, `enif_free_iovec()`\r\n\r\n- **observer/crashdump_viewer**:\r\n    - Reading of crash dumps with many binaries is optimized.\r\n    - A progress bar is shown when the detail view for a process is opened.\r\n    - The cdv script now sets ERL_CRASH_DUMP_SECONDS=0 to\r\n    avoid generating a new crash dump from the node running the Crashdump Viewer.\r\n\r\n- **observer**:\r\n               Add system statistics and limits to frontpage in\r\n               observer.\r\n\r\n- **public_key**, ssl**:\r\n               Improved error propagation and reports\r\n\r\n- **ssh**: A new option `modify_algorithms` is implemented. It\r\n    enables specifying changes on the default algorithms\r\n    list. See the reference manual and the SSH User's Guide\r\n    chapter \"Configuring algorithms in SSH\".\r\n\r\n- **tools/xref**: The predefined Xref analysis locals_not_used now understands \r\n    the `-on_load()` attribute and does not report unused functions.\r\n\r\n- **tools/fprof**: When sampling multiple processes and analyzing\r\n    with totals set to true, the output now sums together\r\n    all caller and callee entries which concerns the same\r\n    function. Previous behaviour was to report each\r\n    contributing entry separately.\r\n\r\nYou can find the README and the full listing of changes for this service release at\r\n\r\n  http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_src_20.1.readme\r\n\r\nThe source distribution and binary distributions for Windows can be\r\ndownloaded from\r\n\r\n  http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_src_20.1.tar.gz\r\n  http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_win32_20.1.exe\r\n  http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_win64_20.1.exe\r\n\r\nNote: To unpack the TAR archive you need a GNU TAR compatible program.\r\n\r\nFor installation instructions please consult the README file that is part\r\nof the distribution.\r\n\r\nThe Erlang/OTP source can also be found at GitHub on the official Erlang\r\nrepository, https://github.com/erlang/otp with tag OTP-20.1\r\n\r\nThe on-line documentation can be found at: http://www.erlang.org/doc/\r\nYou can also download the complete HTML documentation or the Unix manual files\r\n\r\n  http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_doc_html_20.1.tar.gz\r\n  http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_doc_man_20.1.tar.gz\r\n\r\nPlease report any new issues via Erlang/OTPs public issue tracker \r\n\r\n   https://bugs.erlang.org\r\n\r\nWe want to thank all of those who sent us patches, suggestions and bug reports!\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nThe Erlang/OTP Team at Ericsson\r\n",

These are backwards compatible. Minor code and\r\n  documentation improvements has been performed including a\r\n  borderline semantics correction of timeout zero handling.\r\n- SSL: Experimental version of DTLS. It is runnable but not complete\r\n  and cannot be considered reliable for production usage. To use\r\n  DTLS add the option `{protocol, dtls}` to ssl:connect and ssl:listen.\r\n- SSH: Extended the option silently_accept_hosts for ssh:connect to\r\n  make it possible for the client to check the SSH host key\r\n  fingerprint string. Se the reference manual for SSH.\r\n- ~40 contributions since the previous service release OTP 19.1\r\n\r\nYou can find the README and the full listing of changes for this service release at\r\n\r\n  http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_src_19.2.readme\r\n\r\nThe source distribution and binary distributions for Windows can be\r\ndownloaded from\r\n\r\n  http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_src_19.2.tar.gz\r\n  http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_win32_19.2.exe\r\n  http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_win64_19.2.exe\r\n\r\nNote: To unpack the TAR archive you need a GNU TAR compatible program.\r\n\r\nFor installation instructions please consult the README file that is part\r\nof the distribution.\r\n\r\nThe Erlang/OTP source can also be found at GitHub on the official Erlang\r\nrepository, https://github.com/erlang/otp with tag OTP-19.2\r\n\r\nThe on-line documentation can be found at: http://www.erlang.org/doc/\r\nYou can also download the complete HTML documentation or the Unix manual files\r\n\r\n  http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_doc_html_19.2.tar.gz\r\n  http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_doc_man_19.2.tar.gz\r\n\r\nPlease report any new issues via Erlang/OTPs public issue tracker \r\n\r\n   https://bugs.erlang.org\r\n\r\nWe want to thank all of those who sent us patches, suggestions and bug reports!\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nThe Erlang/OTP Team at Ericsson\r\n",

        "body": "Erlang/OTP 19.3 is the third service release for the 19 major release.\r\nThe service release contains mostly bug fixes and characteristics improvements but also some new features.\r\n\r\nSome highlights for 19.3\r\n\r\n- **crypto, ssh**: The implementation of the key exchange algorithms\r\n    diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha* are optimized, up to\r\n    a factor of 11 for the slowest ( = biggest and safest)\r\n    group size. \r\n\r\n- **dialyzer**: The peak memory consumption is reduced.\r\n    Analyzing modules with binary construction with huge\r\n    strings is now much faster.\r\n\r\n- **erts**: A received SIGTERM signal to beam will generate a\r\n               'stop' message to the init process and terminate the\r\n               Erlang VM nicely. This is equivalent to calling\r\n               init:stop/0.\r\n\r\n- **kernel**: The functions in the `file` module that take a list of\r\npaths (e.g. `file:path_consult/2`) will now continue to\r\nsearch in the path if the path contains something that\r\nis not a directory.\r\n\r\n- **kernel**: Two OTP processes that are known to receive many\r\nmessages are `rex` (used by `rpc`) and `error_logger`.\r\nThose processes will now store unprocessed messages\r\noutside the process heap, which will potentially\r\ndecrease the cost of garbage collections.\r\n\r\n- **public_key**: New function `pkix_verify_hostname/2,3` implements\r\ncertificate hostname checking. See the manual and RFC 6125.\r\n\r\n- **public_key, ssh**: The ssh host key fingerprint generation now also takes\r\n               a list of algorithms and returns a list of\r\n               corresponding fingerprints. See\r\n               `public_key:ssh_hostkey_fingerprint/2` and the option               \r\n               `silently_accept_hosts` in `ssh:connect`.\r\n\r\n- **ssl**: Move PEM cache to a dedicated process, to avoid making\r\nthe SSL manager process a bottleneck. This improves\r\nscalability of TLS connections.\r\n\r\n- **stdlib**: `filename:safe_relative_path/1` to sanitize a relative\r\npath has been added.\r\n\r\n- Thanks to more than 20 different contributors\r\n\r\nYou can find the README and the full listing of changes for this service release at\r\n\r\n  http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_src_19.3.readme\r\n\r\nThe source distribution and binary distributions for Windows can be\r\ndownloaded from\r\n\r\n  http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_src_19.3.tar.gz\r\n  http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_win32_19.3.exe\r\n  http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_win64_19.3.exe\r\n\r\nNote: To unpack the TAR archive you need a GNU TAR compatible program.\r\n\r\nFor installation instructions please consult the README file that is part\r\nof the distribution.\r\n\r\nThe Erlang/OTP source can also be found at GitHub on the official Erlang\r\nrepository, https://github.com/erlang/otp with tag OTP-19.3\r\n\r\nThe on-line documentation can be found at: http://www.erlang.org/doc/\r\nYou can also download the complete HTML documentation or the Unix manual files\r\n\r\n  http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_doc_html_19.3.tar.gz\r\n  http://www.erlang.org/download/otp_doc_man_19.3.tar.gz\r\n\r\nPlease report any new issues via Erlang/OTPs public issue tracker \r\n\r\n   https://bugs.erlang.org\r\n\r\nWe want to thank all of those who sent us patches, suggestions and bug reports!\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nThe Erlang/OTP Team at Ericsson\r\n",
